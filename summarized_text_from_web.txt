The second trailer was viewed 268 million times in the first 24 hours, becoming the second most viewed trailer in that time period, behind the film's first trailer. The film, along with Infinity War, were shot using IMAX/Arri 2D cameras, thus marking the first time that a Hollywood feature film was shot entirely with IMAX digital cameras. In India, the film sold one million tickets in just one day for the English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu language screenings; 18 tickets were sold every second. Avengers co-creator Stan Lee has a posthumous cameo in the film, appearing digitally de-aged as a car driver in 1970; this is his final cameo appearance in film. The marketing campaign for Endgame is the largest for any Marvel Studios film, surpassing $200 million and besting Infinity War's $150 million campaign. In July 2016, Marvel removed the film's title, simply referring to it as Untitled Avengers film. Its largest markets after China were South Korea ($8.4 million; the largest non-holiday single day gross ever), Australia ($7.1 million), France ($6 million) and Italy ($5.8 million). The trailer also set a record for Twitter conversation for a film trailer in the first 24 hours generating 549,000 mentions. The same day, Fandango announced the film became its top-selling pre-sale title for the first 24 hours, topping Star Wars: The Force Awakens' previous record in just six hours. Overall, the film made $169 million on the first day from international countries, the highest total of all-time.
